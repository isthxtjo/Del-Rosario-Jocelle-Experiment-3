# Python Data Analysis Assignment(PANDAS)

This assignment includes two Python problem using the Pandas library.

## Problem 1

### Instructions:
- Save the file as `Surname_Pandas-P1.py`.
- Write a Python script that:
  1. Loads the cars dataset into a DataFrame.
  2. Displays the first five and last five rows of the dataset.

### Input:
- I first input the cars data set to make my codes run.

### Output:
- The first five rows of the dataset.
- The last five rows of the dataset.

## Problem 2

### Instructions:
- Save the file as `Surname_Pandas-P2.py`.
- Using the cars DataFrame from Problem 1, perform the following operations:
  1. Display the first five rows, but only show odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, ...).
  2. Display the row that contains the car model 'Mazda RX4'.
  3. Find how many cylinders the 'Camaro Z28' car model has.
  4. Determine how many cylinders and what gear type the car models 'Mazda RX4 Wag', 'Ford Pantera L', and 'Honda Civic' have.

### Input:
- The cars dataset (same as in Problem 1).

### Output:
- First five rows with odd-numbered columns which are the model, cyl, hp, wt, vs, gear.
- The row containing information for the 'Mazda RX4' model. 
- The number of cylinders in 'Camaro Z28'.
- Cylinders and gear types for 'Mazda RX4 Wag', 'Ford Pantera L', and 'Honda Civic'.
